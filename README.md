## Overview
This project analyzes shipment lead times using **pre-cleaned CSV datasets**.  
The Jupyter Notebook consumes final datasets only and focuses on visualization and supplier performance evaluation.

- `cleaned_lead_time_data.csv` – Cleaned shipment-level lead time data
- `supplier_performance_summary.csv` – Supplier-wise performance metrics
- `shipment_data.csv` – Original shipment data (reference)

## Key Analysis

- Identification of late deliveries
- Supplier ranking based on:
  - Average lead time
  - Late delivery rate

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
